The Odin Project Exercise:
Description: As per my understanding, this exercise is about understanding the user attention when he/she visits our website.
             How to draw user's attention to the main content or whatever content you want and impact of typography on user's
             perception of the webpage.

2. I have provided the header to practice proper outlining
